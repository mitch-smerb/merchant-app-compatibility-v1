# Session Notes - merchant-app-compatibility-v1

## 2025-10-30
**Status:** COMPLETE - Major file cleanup and project restructure
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Next:** Begin feedback processing and UI/UX iteration with Mitch
**Blockers:** None - awaiting Mitch's feedback document review

**Completed:**
- Created timestamped backup before all changes (~705MB saved)
- Deleted system cruft (.DS_Store files, .obsidian, empty directories)
- Deleted 3 duplicate V0 reference copies (violated architecture)
- Deleted 703MB node_modules from Inputs/ai-exports (wrong location)
- Deleted outputs/prototype/ and outputs/prototype-code/ (empty/redundant)
- Created archive directory structure (outputs/archive-docs, Inputs/archive-docs)
- Archived 14 historical documents (status docs, conflicting ai-exports docs)
- Updated .gitignore (added .cursor, .obsidian, archive directories)
- Updated root README.md (reflects development phase, not compatibility phase)
- Added status header to REVISION_PLAN.md (IN REVIEW status)
- Created comprehensive app-level README.md with setup instructions
- Verified Pedro/Thiago refactoring already in place (theme/, components/, pages/)
- Build verified successful (3.3s, no errors)

**Key Achievements:**
- Reduced project from messy experimental state to clean, production-ready structure
- Established 12 core procedural documents (one source of truth per topic)
- Eliminated conflicting documentation (multiple READMEs, status docs)
- Applied "docs as code" principle - clarity = AI velocity
- File structure now supports rapid iteration for product-market fit

**Project Transformation:**
- FROM: Experimental AI prototyping with trial-and-error artifacts
- TO: Production development repository with clear standards and rapid iteration capability

**Ready for Next Phase:**
- Collaborative feedback processing (Mitch finishing review → grouping → UI/UX iteration)
- Demo preparation for Nov 4 Columbia Credit Union presentation
- Production launch targeting Nov 14, 2025

## 2025-10-09
**Status:** Created CLAUDE.md with session management instructions
**Next:** Follow FC standards on future sessions
**Blockers:** None

**Completed:**
- Created CLAUDE.md with session start instructions (read FC standards from project_behaviors.md)
- Added session end protocol: write to session_notes.md, write to FC projects.md, confirm completion
- Refined endsession steps based on feedback (removed automatic folder timestamp step)
