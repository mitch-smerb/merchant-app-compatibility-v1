# Project Context - Plink Merchant App V1 Compatibility Phase

## Problem Statement
Integrate AI-generated prototype features into the existing Plink Merchant App architecture while maintaining compatibility with production systems and coding standards.

## Audience
- **Primary**: Pedro (for production review and integration decision)
- **Secondary**: Development team for implementation guidance

## Constraints
- Must be compatible with existing React/TypeScript/Vite stack
- Must follow established component patterns and conventions
- Must integrate with current routing and authentication systems
- Must be ready for production deployment

## Target KPIs
- **Code Compatibility**: 100% buildable and runnable locally
- **Architecture Alignment**: Follows existing patterns and conventions
- **Feature Parity**: All AI prototype features preserved and functional
- **Gap Documentation**: Complete identification of data/API dependencies

## Guardrails
- **Compliance**: Follow existing security and privacy patterns
- **Performance**: Maintain current app performance characteristics  
- **Maintainability**: Use established component library and patterns
- **Cost**: Minimize new dependencies and infrastructure requirements

## Success Criteria
1. Running local preview matching AI prototype visually
2. Code that integrates cleanly with existing app architecture
3. Clear gap report identifying remaining production dependencies
4. Complete dev handoff package ready for Pedro's review
5. All changes clearly marked and documented for production integration

## Timeline
- **Phase Duration**: Proof of concept (not full production implementation)
- **Review Target**: Complete package ready for development team handoff
- **Integration Timeline**: To be determined based on gap analysis results
