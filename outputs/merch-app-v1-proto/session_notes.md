2. Generate Figma Make prompts for approved changes
3. Begin Critical Priority implementation (Welcome screen, advertising language)

**Phase 2 (After approval):**
4. Execute Figma Make prompts for design updates
5. Implement changes in code (follow 4-phase roadmap)
6. Test with merchant focus group
